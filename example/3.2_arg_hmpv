############# Arguments description
## pdb_post = File name or directory of postfusion pdb (the pdb should have been previously aligned with the prefusion structure)
## post_monomer_ch = Chain(s) ID of one postfusion protomer
## pdb_pre = File name or directory of prefusion pdb (the pdb should have been previously aligned with the postfusion structure)
## pre_monomer_ch = Chain(s) ID of one prefusion protomer
## alignment = File name or directory of sequence alignment between prefusion and postfusion (the sequences should contain ONLY amino acids found in the PDB structure (monomer sequence). FASTA format
## post_name_alignment = Name of postfusion protein in alignment file
## pre_name_alignment = Name of prefusion protein in alignment file
## flanking = Number of residues seeking to match their secondary structure to flank the movable areas
## fusion_peptide = Positions (range) corresponding to the fusion peptide (prefusion structure). Make sure these residue positions are unique, i.e. they do not point out to other parts of the protein that are not the fusion peptide.
