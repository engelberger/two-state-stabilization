############# Arguments description
## pre_results_dir = Directory containing the candidate sequences for the prefusion state (filtered by energy---"selection_pre_E") . 
## pre_control_pdb = PDB directory of control structure (relaxed but not designed sequence)
## post_results_dir = Directory containing folder(s) with combinatorial design results for the postfusion state
## pre_monomer_ch = Chain(s) ID of one prefusion protomer
## post_monomer_ch = Chain(s) ID of one postfusion protomer
## alignment = File name or directory of sequence alignment between prefusion and postfusion (the sequences should contain ONLY amino acids found in the PDB structure (monomer sequence). FASTA format
## post_name_alignment = Name of postfusion protein in alignment file
## pre_name_alignment = Name of prefusion protein in alignment file
