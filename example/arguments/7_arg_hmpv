############# Arguments description
## results_dir = Directory containing folder(s) with combinatorial design results for the prefusion state. 
## results_folder = Comma-separated list of folder(s) name(s) with designed prefusion sequences. The folder(s) must be in the results_dir.
## resfile_pre = File name or directory of resfile used to design prefusion sequences
## control_dir = PDB directory of control structure (relaxed but not designed sequence)
## pdb_post = File name or directory of postfusion pdb
## post_monomer_ch = Chain(s) ID of one postfusion protomer
## pdb_pre = File name or directory of prefusion pdb 
## pre_monomer_ch = Chain(s) ID of one prefusion protomer
## alignment = File name or directory of sequence alignment between prefusion and postfusion (the sequences should contain ONLY amino acids found in the PDB structure (monomer sequence). FASTA format
## post_name_alignment = Name of postfusion protein in alignment file
## pre_name_alignment = Name of prefusion protein in alignment file
