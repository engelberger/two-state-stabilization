############# Arguments description
## pre_results_dir = Directory containing the candidate sequences for the prefusion state (filtered by energy---"selection_pre_E"). 
## pre_control_pdb = PDB directory of prefusion control structure (relaxed but not designed sequence).
## post_results_dir = Directory containing folder(s) with combinatorial design results for the postfusion state.
## post_control_pdb = PDB directory of postfusion control structure (relaxed but not designed sequence).
## pre_monomer_ch = Chain ID of the prefusion protomer used in the combinatorial design.
## post_monomer_ch = Chain ID of the postfusion protomer used in the combinatorial design.
## alignment = File name or directory of sequence alignment between prefusion and postfusion (the sequences should contain ONLY amino acids found in the PDB structure (monomer sequence). FASTA format.
## post_name_alignment = Name of postfusion protein in alignment file.
## pre_name_alignment = Name of prefusion protein in alignment file.
## filter= Whether to filter mutations based on per-residue energy differences.
