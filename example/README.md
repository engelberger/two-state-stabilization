> [!NOTE]
> In the exemplary results of all amino acid scanning (step 4), we did not repeat the calculations for alanine substitutions. Instead, we transferred the previous alanine scanning results to the folder containing all amino acid scanning results. The current code repeats the alanine calculations so that all results are in one file.
