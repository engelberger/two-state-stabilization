############# Arguments description
## results_dir = Directory containing folder(s) with combinatorial design results for the prefusion state. 
## results_folder = Comma-separated list of folder name(s) with designed prefusion sequences. The folder(s) must be in the results_dir.
## resfile_pre = File name or directory of resfile used to design prefusion sequences.
## control_dir = PDB directory of control prefusion structure (relaxed but not designed sequence).
## pdb_post = File name or directory of postfusion pdb.
## post_monomer_ch = Chain ID of the postfusion protomer that will be input into the combinatorial design.
## pdb_pre = File name or directory of prefusion pdb (not control pdb).
## pre_monomer_ch = Chain ID of the prefusion protomer used in the combinatorial design.
## alignment = File name or directory of sequence alignment between prefusion and postfusion (the sequences should contain ONLY amino acids found in the PDB structure (monomer sequence). FASTA format.
## post_name_alignment = Name of postfusion protein in alignment file.
## pre_name_alignment = Name of prefusion protein in alignment file.
